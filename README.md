 # Hello!  #
  My name is Lukas and programming from a hobby has become my passion. As I deepened my knowledge mainly about JavaScript (mainly backend), it became clear to me that it was programming that I wanted to tie my professional future into.
  
   ## Technologies I know: ##
  * JavaScript (EcmaSript 6)
  * Node JS
  * Express JS
  * Type Script
  * SQL and NoSQL
  * GIT 
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * React JS
  * Redux / Redux toolkit
  * Nest JS
  
   Below is a short description of my repositories, which I am constantly improving over time. 
  Of course, when I wrote these projects today, I would do some things differently, among others: 
  * I would run the correct git flow from the beginning of the project
  * I would use a different commit system, each application functionality would be a separate commit
  * I would apply to semver (Semantiv versioning)
    
   But I decided to leave the applications as knowledgeable as I was at the time I wrote them so that I can compare my development progress.
    
  **1.Food Order**  
  A simple react app for ordering meals. The state of the application is based on 3 different hooks: useState, useRef and useContext (as part of learning). The order is fetching to the firebase database.   
  App url: https://foodorder.networkmanager.pl
  Code: https://github.com/eLPog/food_order
  
  **2.Tick it off**  
     React application created as a frontend for - To Do List Backend - application. It allows the user to register and log in as well as store, add, edit and delete notes. The state of the application is based on Redux/Toolkit and locals states.      
   App url:  https://www.tickitoff.networkmanager.pl
   Code: https://github.com/eLPog/Tick_it_off
     
  **3.To Do List Backend**  
    REST API for creating a to-do list. I used Jason Web Token to authentication and awilix package to dependency injection rule. This app was prepared in the develop version. Environment variables were used for configuration. The application is located on the server. Details can be found in the readme file.   
  Frontend App url:  https://www.tickitoff.networkmanager.pl
  Code: https://github.com/eLPog/To_Do_List_Backend
   
    
  **4.Cat Care**  
    Cat Care is an app I'm still working on. It is written Nest js and allows you to associate users about caring for a cat when the owner cannot do it himself (vacation, illness, business trip). Registered users can add a cat for which they will create an advertisement later. A user registered as a helper may take such an announcement and undertake to take care of the cat within the time specified in the announcement. If you want to test this app, please use develop branche. Remeber to connect own database.      
  Code: https://github.com/eLPog/CatCare
    
    
   **5.CRM - Simple Customer relationship managementr**  
       This application allows you to add, edit and delete companies, add financial transactions and check the financial balance. Frontend built in handlebars technology and is very simple - only to show logical operations. The data is saved in mongooseDB. A detailed description is in the readme file. You can try this app on https://project2simplecrm.herokuapp.com email to login:test@test.pl password: test123 or You can create your own new Account. Passwords are hashed.   
  App url: https://project2simplecrm.herokuapp.com
  Code:   https://github.com/eLPog/CRM_Fullstack
     
    
 **What's next?**
  1. Writing the React JS project in Type Script
  2. Introducing tests to frontend applications
  3. Learning Docker
  4. Increasing knowledge in the field of JS / TS
  5. Learning another programming language (Java, Python)
