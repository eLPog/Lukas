 # Welcome  #
  My name is Lukas and programming from a hobby has become my passion. As I deepened my knowledge mainly about JavaScript (mainly backend), it became clear to me that it was programming that I wanted to tie my professional future into.
  
   ## Technologies I use: ##
  * JavaScript (EcmaSript 6)
  * Node JS
  * Express JS
  * Nest JS
  * Type Script
  * SQL and NoSQL
  * TypeORM
  * React JS
  * Redux / Redux toolkit
  * Jest
  * GIT 
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * and I'm still learning all of them :)
  
   Below is a short description of my repositories, which I am constantly improving over time. 
  Of course, when I wrote these projects today, I would do some things differently, among others: 
  * I would run the correct git flow from the beginning of the project
  * I would use a different commit system, each application functionality would be a separate commit
  * I would apply to semver (Semantiv versioning)
    
   But I decided to leave the applications as knowledgeable as I was at the time I wrote them so that I can compare my development progress.
