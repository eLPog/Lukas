Hello! 
  My name is Lukas and programming from a hobby has become my passion. As I deepened my knowledge mainly about JavaScript (mainly backend), it became clear to me that it was programming that I wanted to tie my professional future into.
  
  Technologies I know:
  -JavaScript (EcmaSript 6)
  -Node JS
  -Express JS
  -Type Script
  -SQL and NoSQL
  -GIT 
  -HTML5
  -CSS3
  -Bootstrap
  -React JS
  -Jest
  
  Below is a short description of my repositories, which I am constantly improving over time. 
  Of course, when I wrote these projects today, I would do some things differently, among others: 
  -I would run the correct git flow from the beginning of the project
  -I would use a different commit system, each application functionality would be a separate commit
  -I would apply to semver (Semantiv versioning)
    
    But I decided to leave the applications as knowledgeable as I was at the time I wrote them so that I can compare my development progress.
    
   1. CRM - Simple Customer relationship management
      This application allows you to add, edit and delete companies, add financial transactions and check the financial balance. The data is saved in mongooseDB. A detailed description is in the readme file.
  
   2.Backend for To Do List
    REST API for creating a to-do list. I used Jason Web Token to authentication and awilix package to dependency injection rule. Details can be found in the readme file.
    
   3.Cat Care
    Cat Care is an app I'm still working on. It is written Nest js and allows you to associate users about caring for a cat when the owner cannot do it himself (vacation, illness, business trip). Registered users can add a cat for which they will create an advertisement later. A user registered as a helper may take such an announcement and undertake to take care of the cat within the time specified in the announcement. If you want to test this app, please use develop branche. Remeber to connect own database. 
    
    What's next?
  1. Writing the React JS project
  2. Learning Docker
  3. Increasing knowledge in the field of JS / TS
  4. Learning another programming language (Java, Python)
